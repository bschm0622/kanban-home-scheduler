## Known Issues / TypeScript Warnings

There are some TypeScript warnings in the Convex code that don't prevent functionality:
- `convex/tasks.ts`: Circular type inference (doesn't affect runtime)
- `convex/slackNotifications.ts`: Legacy code that still works

These can be cleaned up later but don't impact the app's functionality.
